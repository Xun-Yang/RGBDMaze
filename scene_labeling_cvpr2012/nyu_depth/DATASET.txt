The NYU Depth Dataset (v1) is from Silberman and Fergus and available at:

http://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v1.html

Run the script convert_dataset.m to download the dataset and save images and depths
to individual files with numerical names (mainly to save memory).

To run the experiments, you also need aligned raw depths and gPb-ucm segmentations, available here:

http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~xren/research/cvpr2012_scene/nyu_depth.zip

The raw depth maps we use are slighly different than what are provided in the
dataset. They are projections of raw depth maps into the image coordinates, so
that they align with the processed depth maps (in the variable depths).
